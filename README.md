# Introduction :
In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the widespread adoption of face masks as a preventive measure against the spread of the virus. Consequently, automated systems for detecting whether individuals are wearing masks have gained significant interest and importance. In this project, we propose a machine learning-based approach for face mask detection, aimed at assisting authorities in enforcing mask-wearing policies in public spaces.

The primary objective of this model is to accurately identify whether individuals within images or video streams are wearing masks or not. This task is challenging due to variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and the diverse array of mask types and wear styles. To address these challenges, we leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks.

Our proposed model is trained on a large dataset of annotated images containing individuals with and without masks. We employ transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained CNN architectures such as ResNet, MobileNet, or VGG, which enables us to achieve high accuracy even with limited training data. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the model and mitigate overfitting.

The developed face mask detection system holds significant potential for real-world applications, including monitoring compliance with mask mandates in public spaces, enhancing safety measures in workplaces, and aiding law enforcement agencies in ensuring public health regulations are adhered to. By providing an efficient and automated solution for mask detection, our model contributes to efforts aimed at controlling the spread of infectious diseases and safeguarding public health.

In the subsequent sections of this report, we present a detailed description of our methodology, including dataset collection and preprocessing, model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss the implementation aspects and provide insights into the model's performance through experimental results and analysis. Finally, we conclude with potential avenues for future research and applications of the developed face mask detection system.

# Dataset:
 Contains images with both mask and no mask which is collected from kaggle.

# About model :
The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

# Real-Time Application :
 These types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks, in areas like Public Transportation Hubs,Retail Stores and Malls,Healthcare Facilities,Smart Cities and Urban Planning ETC.
